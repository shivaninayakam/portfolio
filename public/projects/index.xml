      <description>Description Implemented advanced image processing algorithms for real-time face detection, facial component extraction, and tracking using OpenCV, improving the system&amp;rsquo;s accuracy in diverse lighting conditions.
Developed algorithms to calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Open Ratio (MOR), critical metrics for assessing driver alertness, and established threshold-based alert systems to prevent potential accidents.
Conducted extensive testing to calibrate and optimize drowsiness detection thresholds, ensuring reliable performance of the system in detecting early signs of driver fatigue.</description>
