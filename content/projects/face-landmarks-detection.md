## Description

- Implemented advanced image processing algorithms for real-time face detection, facial component extraction, and tracking using OpenCV, improving the system's accuracy in diverse lighting conditions.

- Developed algorithms to calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Open Ratio (MOR), critical metrics for assessing driver alertness, and established threshold-based alert systems to prevent potential accidents.

- Conducted extensive testing to calibrate and optimize drowsiness detection thresholds, ensuring reliable performance of the system in detecting early signs of driver fatigue.

- Aimed to integrate this cost-effective and scalable system into commercial vehicles to enhance driver safety, with future enhancements planned to support a broader range of vehicles and driving conditions.
